    <p>There has never been a clear report of human being eaten by wild killer whales. So, among predators strong enough to attack and kill humans easily on Earth, the killer whale is the only known case of pre-emptive attacks on humans as a target of predestination or predestination in a healthy wild state. Even predators who don't see humans as food sometimes mistook and attack humans as food. In addition, killer whales hunt not only as food, but simply as 'funny' seals, except humans. It is certainly different from land predators such as tigers and wolves, which have been called compatible in the past. There have been several reports of killer whales tracking humans down as seals or sea lions. However, when the killer whale approached and found out that the target was human, it immediately stopped pursuing it. There is also a video clip of a penguin or seal tracking its prey, but it stops chasing as soon as the penguin or seal is on a human boat. The power and ability of the killer whale can be enough to turn the boat upside down or catch it.</p>
    <p>There is also a theory that killer whales do not attack humans because they only eat the prey they learn from their parents. There are killer whales that eat seals and killer whales that do not, and the problem is that analysis of their stomachs and other contexts in their bodies suggests that this hypothesis is likely to be wrong. The killer whale preyed on not only dogs, but also other creatures unfamiliar to killer whales such as otters, deer and moose (#) apparently not the common prey of the killer whale. And there are certainly fewer opportunities for killer whales to encounter such animals during their lifetime than for humans who can use ships to shoot far into the sea. In other words, killer whales, like other carnivores, are likely to have a habit of eating and watching once, but somehow an exception for humans.</p>
    <p>First of all, there is little possibility that humans have hunted large killer whales at a global level before modern times, and in history, whale hunting began in modern times. In the past, rumors circulated that the Roman fleet slaughtered killer whales in Rome, but never before. It was a time when ocean navigation was impossible in the first place[44][45] There is a record of Rome being harmed by the killer whale, but there is no record of hunting, and the Romans fear the miraculous power of the killer whale. At the port of Ostia in Rome, the historian Plynius, who recorded a stranded killer whale being dealt with by Emperor Claudius, described it as a fearful being. In other words, the killer whale was recognized by humans as such that people recorded a human encounter at that time</p>
